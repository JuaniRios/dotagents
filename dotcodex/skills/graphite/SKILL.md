# graphite

Codex adaptation of the Claude skill `graphite`. Follow the workflow below, but use Codex-native tools and normal user questions where the original mentions Claude-only mechanisms.

Compatibility notes:
- Treat `$ARGUMENTS` as the relevant arguments or intent from the user's request.
- Replace `AskUserQuestion` with a concise question to the user when a decision is required.
- Replace Claude `Agent` calls with Codex subagents only when the user explicitly asks for parallel agents; otherwise do the work locally.
- Ignore Claude `allowed-tools`, `argument-hint`, `TodoWrite`, and `Skill` tool references as tool-permission metadata.
- When the workflow mentions another slash command, use the corresponding Codex skill or follow that workflow directly.

# Graphite (`gt`) — the version-control tool for this user

**Read this before touching version control.** This user uses Graphite stacked
PRs. `gt` wraps git, preserves stack metadata, and keeps parent/child branches
consistent through rebases. Using raw `git` for mutations silently breaks the
stack.

## The Core Rule

> **Never use `git` to mutate state. Always use `gt`.**

| Task                                  | Correct                   | Wrong                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Create a new branch + commit          | `gt create <name>`        | `git checkout -b` + `git commit` |
| Amend current branch                  | `gt modify`               | `git commit --amend`   |
| Create a follow-up commit on branch   | `gt modify --commit`      | `git commit`           |
| Stack a branch on another             | `gt create` (from parent) | `git rebase --onto`    |
| Rebase stack onto latest trunk        | `gt restack` / `gt sync`  | `git rebase main`      |
| Push branches + open/update PRs       | `gt submit`               | `git push` + `gh pr create` |
| Switch branches                       | `gt checkout <name>`      | `git checkout <name>`  |
| Fetch trunk + clean up merged         | `gt sync`                 | `git pull` + manual cleanup |
| Move a branch to a new parent         | `gt move`                 | `git rebase --onto`    |
| Split a branch                        | `gt split`                | manual cherry-pick     |
| Squash branch commits                 | `gt squash`               | `git rebase -i`        |
| Delete a branch (and restack kids)    | `gt delete <name>`        | `git branch -D`        |

## When `git` is OK

Read-only inspection only. `gt` does not wrap everything, and for these `git`
is fine (and expected):

- `git diff` (and `git --no-pager diff` — avoid the pager)
- `git diff $(gt parent)..HEAD` — parent-aware stack diff
- `git log`, `git log --oneline`, `git log -p`
- `git status`
- `git blame`
- `git show <sha>`
- `git stash list` / `git stash show`
- `git merge-base`, `git rev-parse`

**Never** run: `git commit`, `git commit --amend`, `git checkout -b`, `git
rebase`, `git reset --hard`, `git push`, `git pull`, `git merge`, `git cherry-pick`,
`git branch -D`. Use the `gt` equivalent.

## Command reference (grouped by workflow)

### Setup / auth

- `gt init` — initialize a repo for Graphite (pick trunk). Run once per repo.
- `gt auth --token <token>` — authenticate with Graphite cloud (for `gt submit`).

### Create & edit

- `gt create <name>` *(alias `gt c`)* — new stacked branch on top of current branch, commits staged changes. Always stage first (`gt add <files>` or `git add <files>`).
- `gt modify` *(alias `gt m`)* — amend current branch's commit, automatically restacks descendants. Use `--commit` to create a new commit instead of amending.
- `gt absorb` — auto-distribute staged hunks into the right commits downstack. Powerful for fixing review feedback across a stack.
- `gt split` — split current branch by commit, hunk, or file into a new stack.
- `gt squash` — collapse all commits in the current branch into one.
- `gt fold` — fold the current branch into its parent.

### Navigate the stack

- `gt log short` *(alias `gt ls`)* — compact stack view. Use this first when orienting.
- `gt log long` *(alias `gt ll`)* — detailed stack view with commits.
- `gt up` *(alias `gt u`)* — move to child branch.
- `gt down` *(alias `gt d`)* — move to parent branch.
- `gt top` / `gt bottom` — jump to tip / base of current stack.
- `gt checkout [branch]` *(alias `gt co`)* — switch branches (interactive if omitted).
- `gt parent` — print the current branch's parent.
- `gt children` — list descendants.
- `gt trunk` — print trunk for current branch.

### Submit & sync

- `gt submit` *(alias `gt s`)* — push current branch and all downstack branches, open/update PRs. Use `--stack` for the whole stack, `--no-interactive` for scripts, `--no-edit-description` to keep existing PR descriptions, `--draft` for draft PRs, `--dry-run` to preview.
- `gt sync` — fetch trunk from remote, rebase all stacks on top, prompt to delete merged branches. Run at the start of every session on a branch that depends on trunk.
- `gt restack` — re-parent every branch in the current stack onto its parent's latest commit. Run after `gt modify` in a lower branch to propagate to children (though `gt modify` usually does this automatically).
- `gt get [branch]` — pull a branch (and its stack) from remote with conflict resolution.
- `gt move` — move the current branch onto a new parent (`gt move --onto <branch>`), restacks descendants.
- `gt reorder` — interactively reorder branches in the current stack.

### Conflicts

When a `gt` command halts on a conflict:

1. Resolve the conflicts in the working tree (check `git status`, edit files).
2. `gt add <resolved files>` (or `git add`).
3. `gt continue` — resume the interrupted operation.
4. Or `gt abort` to bail out entirely.
5. After the whole operation finishes: `gt undo` reverts the most recent `gt`
   operation if you change your mind.

Never run `git rebase --continue` or `git rebase --abort` during a `gt`
operation — it will desync stack metadata.

### Information

- `gt info [branch]` — show metadata for a branch (parent, PR link, etc.).
- `gt pr [branch]` — open the PR page in the browser.
- `gt dash` — open the Graphite web dashboard.

## Workflows

### Start a new feature off trunk

```bash
gt sync                          # refresh trunk
gt checkout main                 # or your trunk
# edit files
gt add <files>                   # stage
gt create my-feature             # new branch + commit
gt submit                        # push + open PR
```

### Stack a second branch on top of the first

```bash
# from my-feature
# edit more files
gt add <files>
gt create my-feature-pt2         # stacks on my-feature
gt submit --stack                # submits both PRs
```

### Address review feedback on a lower branch

```bash
gt down                          # move to the branch with the feedback
# edit files
gt add <files>
gt modify                        # amends; descendants auto-restack
gt submit --stack                # force-pushes the whole stack
```

### Sync after trunk moves

```bash
gt sync                          # pulls trunk, rebases stacks, offers cleanup
# resolve conflicts if prompted -> gt add ... && gt continue
```

### Inspect what's in the current PR

```bash
gt log short                     # see the stack shape
git --no-pager diff $(gt parent)..HEAD   # parent-aware diff = exactly the PR contents
```

Important: `git diff main..HEAD` is **wrong** on a stacked branch — it includes
the ancestor PRs too. Always diff against `gt parent`.

### Recover from a mistake

- `gt undo` — revert the last `gt` operation.
- Never use `git reset --hard` to "fix" a broken stack — run `gt restack` or
  `gt sync` first and let graphite do the right thing.

## Scripting / non-interactive use

When running `gt` from an automation or non-TTY context, pass:

- `--no-interactive` — skip prompts (required for scripts).
- `--no-edit` / `--no-edit-description` — don't open an editor.
- `--dry-run` — print what would happen without doing it.

Example: `gt submit --stack --no-interactive --no-edit-description`

## When this user says...

- **"commit this"** → stage with `git add`, then `gt create <name>` (new branch) or `gt modify` (amend current).
- **"push this"** → `gt submit` (or `gt submit --stack` if they want the whole stack).
- **"rebase on main"** → `gt sync` (not `git rebase main`).
- **"create a PR"** → `gt submit`. Do not use `gh pr create` directly — graphite handles it.
- **"update the PR"** → `gt modify` then `gt submit`.
- **"new branch stacked on this"** → `gt create <name>` after staging.
- **"what's in this PR"** → `git --no-pager diff $(gt parent)..HEAD` (diff vs parent).
- **"switch to <branch>"** → `gt checkout <branch>`.
- **"delete this branch"** → `gt delete <branch>` (restacks children automatically).

## Hard rules

1. Never run `git commit`, `git push`, `git rebase`, or `git checkout -b` in a
   graphite-managed repo.
2. Always diff a stacked branch against `gt parent`, never against `main`.
3. When a `gt` operation conflicts, use `gt continue`/`gt abort`, never the git
   equivalents.
4. Run `gt sync` before starting work and after trunk moves.
5. In non-interactive contexts always pass `--no-interactive` to `gt submit`.
6. Before running any mutating `gt` command, verify you're on the expected
   branch (`gt log short` or `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`).
